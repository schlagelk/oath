Software Developer Oath
===

*The purpose of this document is to advance the standard of professionalism of our field in an environment in which responsibility for ethical oversight is left to market forces.*


I acknowledge the responsibilities provided to me as a technical leader at my firm.  My purpose is to, either alone or as part of a team of other technical leaders, create value at my company by possessing knowledge of complicated systems which are not easily understood by people outside my profession.



My decisions affect the prosperity of individuals within my company and clients alike.


Therefore, I promise that:

I will cause no unnecessary harm by creating functionality that already exists or has no purpose.

I will never take advantage of the ignorance of those outside of my field regarding complex technical matters.

I will be conscious of the probabilistic risk I may introduce into my systems.

I will not advance the illusion of perfection or defect-free software.

I will consider the benefits of inaction in the face of incomplete or disputable evidence.

I will not advance the use of technological solutions which I myself do not understand.

I will refrain from giving in to pressures which compromise the integrity of our field and will report requests to do so to my leaders.

I will invest in the growth of myself and others in my field by continuing to advance ethical behavior in our profession while continuing to create valuable technologies.

**This oath I make freely, and upon my honor**
